    extract: An electrolarynx, sometimes referred to as a "throat back", is a medical
      device about the size of a small electric razor used to produce clearer speech
      by those people who have lost their voice box, usually due to cancer of the
      larynx. The most common device is a handheld, battery-operated device pressed
      against the skin under the mandible which produces vibrations to allow speech;
      other variations include a device similar to the "talk box" electronic music
      device, which delivers the basis of the speech sound via a tube placed in the
      mouth. Earlier non-electric devices were called mechanical larynxes. Along with
      developing esophageal voice, using a speech synthesizer, or undergoing a surgical
      procedure, the electrolarynx serves as a mode of speech recovery for laryngectomy
      patients.

      extremely thin atmosphere of Mars, and was the first aircraft to conduct a powered

      Laboratory (JPL) in collaboration with AeroVironment, NASA's Ames Research Center
      and Langley Research Center with some components supplied by Lockheed Martin
      Space, Qualcomm, and SolAero.

    displaytitle: Space Shuttle <i>Columbia</i>
    extract: Space Shuttle Columbia (OV-102) was a Space Shuttle orbiter manufactured
      by Rockwell International and operated by NASA. Named after the first American
      ship to circumnavigate the upper North American Pacific coast and the female
      personification of the United States, Columbia was the first of five Space Shuttle
      orbiters to fly in space, debuting the Space Shuttle launch vehicle on its maiden
      flight on April 12, 1981. As only the second full-scale orbiter to be manufactured
      after the Approach and Landing Test vehicle Enterprise, Columbia retained unique
      features indicative of its experimental design compared to later orbiters, such
      as test instrumentation and distinctive black chines. In addition to a heavier
      fuselage and the retention of an internal airlock throughout its lifetime, these
      made Columbia the heaviest of the five spacefaring orbiters; around 1,000 kilograms
      heavier than Challenger and 3,600 kilograms heavier than Endeavour. Columbia
      also carried ejection seats based on those from the SR-71 during its first six
      flights until 1983, and from 1986 onwards carried an imaging pod on its vertical
      stabilizer.

    extract: Baptism is a Christian sacrament of initiation and adoption, almost invariably
      with the use of water. It may be performed by sprinkling or pouring water on
      the head, or by immersing in water either partially or completely, traditionally
      three times, once for each person of the Trinity. The synoptic gospels recount
      that John the Baptist baptised Jesus. Baptism is considered a sacrament in most
      churches, and as an ordinance in others. Baptism according to the Trinitarian
      formula, which is done in most mainstream Christian denominations, is seen as
      being a basis for Christian ecumenism, the concept of unity amongst Christians.
      Baptism is also called christening, although some reserve the word "christening"
      for the baptism of infants. In certain Christian denominations, such as the
      Catholic Churches, Eastern Orthodox Churches, Oriental Orthodox Churches, Assyrian
      Church of the East, and Lutheran Churches, baptism is the door to church membership,
      with candidates taking baptismal vows. It has also given its name to the Baptist
      churches and denominations.
